A structured sentiment analysis dataset, derived from social media comments, is introduced in this paper. The dataset spans 22 diverse domains and comprises over 200,000 reviews, providing a rich resource for sentiment analysis tasks in the Chinese language context. Each comment within the dataset has been manually annotated with a sentiment label, either positive, negative, or neutral, and grouped by topic.
